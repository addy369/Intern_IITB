# Intern_IITB
This repository is a collection of work done as part of my internship at Medal Labs IITB under Dr Amit Sethi

The work done is specificlly on domain adaptation or domain generalization in the context of histopathology images.
The dataset primarily used is the Bach Data.

I have implemented 2 papers primarily
1)Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ganin15.pdf)
2)Deep Domain Generalization via Conditional Invariant Adversarial Networks(http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ya_Li_Deep_Domain_Generalization_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)

The dataset as well as code is availabe on the repo
