This repository is a collection of work done as part of my internship at Medal Labs IITB under Dr Amit Sethi.


Problem Statement: Domain Adaptation/generalization on Histopathology images


Papers implemented:

1)Deep domain generalization via conditional invariant adversarial networks

http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ya_Li_Deep_Domain_Generalization_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf

2)Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ganin15.pdf

There is also a base code on binary classification and can be used for various other tasks also.

The data is BACH data and in

<b>CASE 1</b> 
Deep Domain Generalization
sample image label is

ROI__0__A05__layer__0__3663__12676__2196__1249___0_400.png

where 05 is the domain label

Also classification is binary class i.e benign and insitu cancer

<b>CASE 2</b>

Unsupervised domain adaptation

binary domain test data is domain 1 and target domain is domain 0
binary classification task of benign vs insitu
